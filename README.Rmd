# Data Simulation Workshop Materials ![](man/figures/logo.png){style="float:right; width:200px;"}

Being able to simulate data allows you to:

* prep analysis scripts for pre-registration
* calculate power and sensitivity for analyses that don't have empirical methods
* create reproducible examples when your data are too big or confidential to share
* enhance your understanding of statistical concepts
* create demo data for teaching and tutorials

## Installation

You can install the packages used in these tutorials and get a function that makes it easy to access the workshop .Rmd files by running the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("debruine/data-sim-workshops")
```

Load exercises with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dsw::exercise("faux")
dsw::exercise("calories")
dsw::exercise("fixed")
dsw::exercise("mixed")
```

Alternatively, download the stub files and install the specific packages for your workshop. They will be listed below under "Prep".

## Upcoming Workshops

### Data simulation for fixed effects

When: Wednesday September 14 09:00 - 10:30 (CET)  
Where: Polish Association of Social Psychology Conference, Gdánsk

This session will cover the basics of simulation using {faux}. We will simulate data with factorial designs by specifying the within and between-subjects factor structure, each cell mean and standard deviation, and correlations between cells where appropriate. This can be used to create simulated data sets to be used in preparing the analysis code for pre-registrations or registered reports. We will also create data sets for simulation-based power analyses. Students will need to have very basic knowledge of R and R Markdown, and have installed {faux}, {afex}, {broom} and {tidyverse}.

#### Prep

* Install R packages from CRAN: `tidyverse`, `afex`, `faux`, and `broom`
* Download files:  [faux-stub.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debruine/data-sim-workshops/master/inst/stubs/faux-stub.Rmd)

### Data simulation for mixed designs

When: Wednesday September 14 11:00 - 13:00 (CET)  
Where: Polish Association of Social Psychology Conference, Gdánsk

This session will cover simulating data for a mixed design, where trials are crossed with subjects. We will learn how to analyse this using {lme4}, with a focus on understanding how the simulation parameters correspond to the output. Finally, we will learn how to use simulation to calculate power. Students will need to have basic knowledge of R and R Markdown, some familiarity with mixed designs (even if they don't currently analyse them with mixed models) and have installed {faux}, {afex}, {tidyverse}, and {lme4}.

#### Prep

* Install R packages from CRAN: `tidyverse`, `afex`, `lme4`, `broom`, `broom.mixed`, `faux`
* Download files: [mixed-stub.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debruine/data-sim-workshops/master/inst/stubs/mixed-stub.Rmd)


### Practical Session

When: Wednesday September 14 14:00 - 16:00 (CET)  
Where: Polish Association of Social Psychology Conference, Gdánsk

Bring your own study designs to simulate, or work on provided exercises.

#### Prep

* Download files: [calories-stub.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debruine/data-sim-workshops/master/inst/stubs/calories-stub.Rmd)
